# LoadApp Project with Udacity

This app is my submission for an exercise project app part of the "Android Nanodegree" online class with Udacity.com.

It showcases usage of advanced Android development: Custom Views, Property Animations, Rich Notifications with actions and Intent, Animations with MotionLayout, downloading files with DownloadManager

# Features

* The app proposes 3 github repository zip files to download
* The app uses a custom view with property animations for the loading button (when the file is downloading)
* The app sends a notification when the download is finished, with an action button. The notification opens the Detail Screen when tapped on
* The app uses animations with MotionLayout in the Detail Screen
